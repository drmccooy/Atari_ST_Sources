@node "p2sm_purpose" "P2SM: why this image tool?"

 I used D2M for a long time for GEM games development, working on sprites
 sets or pictures from tools such as Ultimate Ripper Cartridge.
 This was painful and hard work, since background color used for mask had
 to be isolated from rasters. And blocks had to be created to separate 
 animations and types of objects.
 Work was done in 16 or 256 colors screenmodes.
   
 With no more Falcon in hand, emulators such as NoSTalgia and AtariX were
 used on my Macbook Air. But these are deprecated since macOS Catalina.
 Unfortunatly, Aranym and Hatari eat a lot of CPU and my Macbook's fan gets
 crazy. These can only be launched for a few minutes for tests or just
 one image fix.
    
 I hoped D2M could run natively on the V4SA, but D2M reveals itself to be
 a total crap, deciphering or auto-modifying itself at start, crashing on new
 CPUs such as the 68080 and/or new True Colors screenmodes.
    
 So I decided to code an image tool that would suits to my needs (usage I had
 when using D2M) and truly compatible with GEM and enhanced AtariOS.
    
 And put old D2M definitely to the vault.
   
 Upgrades for evolved (yet for pixel artwork) drawing application are planned.
 Feel free to suggest features you would want for your own usage.

 This software works on 2/16/256 colors images in a chunky way so that it's 
 screenmode independant. You may edit a 256 colors image in a duochrome
 screenmode, but it's a bit silly. You don't have to downgrade from your
 convenient TC32 environment to handle and work on 2/16/256 colors images.
    
 The chunky datas for the raster builds the final (zoomed) image shown in
 the raster workshop window. So it may be slow if you swap from large 
 image to another.
    
 Requirements:
    
 ú EdDI cookie is mandatory, for offscreen VDI. Better choice is NVDI.
   
   NB: fVDI offscreen functions may seem available, but are not implemented.
   So alert is bypassed but raster won't be displayed. If you use fVDI as
   basic VDI layer, add also NVDI ontop to complete offscreen functions.
  
 ú Multitasking OS, NVDI and very quick CPU are strongly advised.
   
 ú PARX.SYS modules to Read and Write some images formats. A small and 
 customized parx.sys folder is provided for small footprint on screen and
 human interaction. PI1/3 and NEO formats are saved natively.
    
 ú the more RAM available, the merrier. There is no limitation of loaded
 images, so rasters can populate a large amount of memory. Moreover, the
 Zoom x2 to x16 is RAM consuming if large images/sprites sets. 
 If you are short in RAM, then work in the 16 or 256 colors screenmode
 corresponding to the number of colors of your images.

 P2SM is freeware. Source code is provided for general knowledge,
 possible fork and issues search. Monetizing on this work is forbidden.
    
 It is strongly advised to make frequent backups of your datas.

 As always, we deny any responsibility concerning any errors, bugs
 or limitations of the program on your personal data, and on
 your computer. We try hard to seek out errors and to correct them.

@node "p2sm_supported_formats" "P2SM: supported images formats"

 By default, the Parx M&E Read and Write Image Modules are used.
 
 Only image formats with palette (CLUT) are allowed.
 
 ú @{0U}GIF@{0} 
   
 - Versatile format, so the favorite one.
  
 - GIF680x0.RIM and .WIM handles it, but the RIM has 2048px width glitches
   bugs, so better not use extra-larges images.
   Also only for GIF87a = no GIF89a extensions supported.
   c2p process is done by the module, so P2SM must call a p2c functions
   to have image raster in final chunky format.
     
 -> @{0B}So GIFdec.ldg and GIFenc.ldg have been developped to fix these issues.@{0}
    Loading and saving are quicker: c2p+p2c double process is avoided.
    These LDG libraries are targeted for 68000, 68020-68060, ColdFire, so
    speed is also improved according to the CPU.
    And GIF89a extensions are supported: transparency and/or animations are
    possible.
    @{0B}Installing these librairies is strongly advised.@{0}
      
 ú @{0U}PI1/PI3/NEO@{0} 
         
 - Legacy ST format, can be used if the image size and bitplane number
   fit into the standard.
    
 - Colors are saved in STE format (4 bits for each R,G,B components).
    
 - No WIM for these, saving is done internaly by GFA code in P2SM.

 ú @{0U}XIMG@{0} 

 - Legacy GEM format.
   
 - May be disabled if the width is not multiple of 16 pixels.
    
 - Due to lack of precision in the official Atari documentations, the color
   index order can be fixed for 'VDIX' (Shifter order) or 'VDI' (VDI order)
   in the Palette Preferences.
      
 ú @{0U}TNY@{0} and others
  
 - Other formats with palette can be added in the RIM folder for import only.
  
 - Saving other than .GIF, .IMG, .PI1, PI3, .NEO are not yet possible.
   Please request if you need some legacy formats to be handled (.PI4-PI9?)
 
@endnode

@node "p2sm_images_list1" "P2SM: images list (in image editor mode)"

  Only image files with palette are supported and 2/16/256 colors.
  For now, images with 3,5,6,7 bitplanes will not be correctly loaded 
  (possible fixes in the future).
 
  In multitasking environment, you can drag'n'drop files and folders from
  the desk to load a series of images.
  To avoid mass effects, only level -1 of the folders content will be loaded.
  
  Program argument is supported at launch to load
  - one image file, 
  - or one folder containing images files inside (just one level),
  - or one images list (*.ILT) file.

  "Paste as new" and "Duplicate" functions need a selected image to copy
  some datas and palette.
  
  Key short-cut for closing an image is ^Del and not ^U.
  
  Up and Down arrows keys permits to change selected image.

  Closing all closes all images except those with the modified state.

@{0B}Load and save list@{0} 

  The complete list can be saved into *.ilt file (ILT for Image List Text)
  which describes opened images and their current states (tool mode, zoom,
  color index of pen/gum/null, etc).
 
  Purpose is to resume work by loading the images list, like a project. 
  An option in the preferences can clear the current list before loading
  new list.
  
  You can link *.ILT files with P2SM.PRG in your desktop configuration.

@{0B}Multiple selection@{0} 

  With Shift key hold and mouse click. Edited image is always the first
  of the selection.
  
@{0B}Layers@{0} 

  Selected images can be grouped for a new layer (assembly or animation)
  with the right clicked pop-up.

@{0B}Export list@{0} 
  
  Selected items in the image list (or all items if no selection) metadatas
  can be exported to the text clipboard. This functionality is available from
  the right clicked pop-up.
  
  The metadatas can be chosen in the preferences.
  
  By pasting this text, this should ease sprites database long list writings.
  See the 'makefile' tool to convert a text list into binary datalist, such as 
  sprites index.

@{0B}Encapsulate@{0} (GIFenc.ldg must be installed)
 
  Two or more selected images can be grouped in one GIF image file as containor.
  
  GIF89a preferences will apply. 
  The background color of the first image will be saved. 
  Size of the canvas will be set at the maximum of widths and heights found. 
  
  Make sure you order the selected images accordingly to your need. This order
  will be the same for the frames indexes in the GIF containor.
 
  Can be convenient to store a group of sprites in one compressed file.
  Make sure you keep image sources for security, some informations such as
  names and maybe color palettes (depending on your GIF89a preferences) can
  be lost.
 
@endnode

@node "p2sm_image_metadatas" "P2SM: image metadatas"
    
  You can change some images informations there, such as:
    
  - name (the current folder is kept, except if you "save as"). The
    DOS 8+3 name format can be mandatory if you have set it in the
    preferences.
    
  - format and extension. GIF is favoured. (X)IMG can be used if width
    is a 16px multiple. NEO and PI1/3 need to tie in precise width, height
    and colors number.
    For NEO and PI1, colors are saved in STE bit-format.
      
  - bitplane number can be changed. The chunky values are lost only when 
    saving files and quitting. The old data can be retreived if you have
    saved the palette into file before the first change.

  - width and height can be changed also. Width can be 16px multiple if you
    have set it in the preferences.
 
@endnode

@node "p2sm_raster_workshop1" "P2SM: raster workshop (in image editor mode)"


@{0B}Zoom@{0} (- and + keys of the numeric pad): 

  - Uses offscreen VDI functions to draw from x1 to x16. Need EdDI cookie.
  
  - Uses a lot of TT-RAM, so with larges images it may be better to leave
    True Color and return to 256 colors screenmode.
    
  - With Shift key and -/+/buttons, zoom is modified on all loaded images.
  

@{0B}Undo / Redo @{0} (respectively ^Z and ^Y): 

  - Uses a lot of RAM, one memory allocation for each image. 
    Old TOS supports a limited amount of memory allocations, so one should
    not open too many images.
  - Modifications history is purged at closing or saving.
  - Extends as long as memory is available. If new memory allocation is not
    possible at one point, then 50%+ of old history is purged.
  

@{0B}Edition modes@{0}:

   When pick action is active (mouse cursor is pointing hand), you can escape
   this action with Right click or Left click outside the raster.
   
   With Shift key and Function key or Shift pressed before pop-up, 
   the mode is applied to all opened images.


 - @{0U}Block select (F1 key):@{0}

   No use of rubberbox.
   Left click selects the left-top corner of a new block, its width and height
   are set by default (32*32, can be modified in the preferences).
   Right click modifies the right-bottom corner of the block.
   
   Arrow keys can move the selection on the left-top corner, keeping width
   and height.
   Shift+Arrow keys resize the selection, width and/or height.

   The block appears as inverted in the display.
   To deselect, set negative width or height, ie right-click at the left or top
   of the block.

   The cut block is replaced by the null color.
   This null color can be choosen in the pop-up or picked from the image. Use
   Key N for shortcut.

   Block is copied/cut into the system clipboard, the format is binary and
   written to scrap.hex file (Pixel = Byte, value is VDI color index encoded
   in hexa-2 letters, CR+LF at line end).

   For paste function, you can set a null/void button and the specific color.
   Thus activated, the paste will not add the pixels of choosen color to the
   image.
   Pick the pixel which will be the left-top corner of the pasted array.
  
   If block exists, then the image can be cropped (^K Key or button). Only
   the block will remain as replaced image. Careful, there is no undo.
   
 
 - @{0U}Pixels draw (F2 key):@{0}

   Left click is Pen. Key P to pick color from the raster instead of the pop-up.
   Right click is Gum. Key G to pick a color from the raster.


 - @{0U}Brush (F3 key):@{0}

   Left click to apply the choosen shape with pen color.
   Right click draw the shape with gum color.
   
   For now, shapes can be modified using a ressource editor 
   (Tree 24, 1 bitplane icons).

 
 - @{0U}Flood filler (F4 key):@{0}

   Left click to fill the pointed color zone by pen color.
   Right click to fill with gum color.


 - @{0U}Rectangle (F5 key):@{0}

   Uses a rubberbox to acquire top-left corner at first click,
   and bottom-right corner at click release.
   The 'settings' button opens Tools attributes window for fine settings.
   'a=b' equal sides button force to draw a square.
   Used color is pen color.


 - @{0U}Ellipse (F6 key):@{0}

   Uses a rubberbox to acquire positions at first click and click release.
   The 'settings' button opens Tools attributes window for fine settings.
   'a=b' equal sides button force to draw a square.
   Used color is pen color.


 - @{0U}Polyline (F7 key):@{0}

   Left click to set line start. Use right click to complete the line.
   You can continue to use right click to draw a polyline.
   The 'settings' button opens Tools attributes window for fine settings.
   Used color is pen color.

 This export is called from the images list, with right-click pop-up or "?"
 button on multiple selection, or none selected (the whole list will be
 exported then).

 ú Id number: starting at number. The id is incremented for the next images.
   
 ú X value: can be the x-position of the sprite active point

      From the layer, writes the X value set there, if not exist, writes 0   
   
 ú Y value: can be the y-position of the sprite active point
            or position shift on y from parent sprite or scenery.
         
      Top -> writes 0
      Middle -> writes (image height - 1)/2

      From the layer, writes the Y value set there, if not exist, writes 0   

 ú Width
 ú Height
   
 ú Colordepth: -> 1 for duochrome (generally for mask), else 0
               -> bitplane number true value

 ú Filename: Full path and name of the image file. The paths can be truncated
             after in the text editor by using its replace function.
             The value can be uppercased.
             The file extension can be discarded.

  If you search for a color remap using an imposed palette, see this in the
  preferences in the Palette panel. If enabled, the palette of the first
  listed image will be used as palette for next loaded images.

  The Undo/Redo does not apply for palette modifications. Make a secure backup
  by saving it.


@{0B}Colors manipulator@{0}:

   Key C to pick and select a color from the raster.
   
   ^F1: Load palette
   ^F2: Save palette
   ^F3: Update color in raster

 - Loaded/Saved palette files follow the PARX palette format:
   
   ú 2 LONG for "PARX_PAL"
   ú 1 INT for number version (200 is kept)
   ú 1 INT for the bitplane number
   then series of N triplets in VDI order
   ú 1 INT for red (0 to 1000)
   ú 1 INT for green (0 to 1000)
   ú 1 INT for blue (0 to 1000)

   File extension is .P0x where x is bitplane number.
   To expand and manage a versatile number of colors for palette edition,
   x can be continous from 0 to 8, so it allows to store 2^x colors. 
     
    .P00 -> just 1 color
    .P01 -> 2 colors
    .P02 -> 4 colors
    .P03 -> 8 colors
    .P04 -> 16 colors
    .P05 -> 32 colors
    .P06 -> 64 colors
    .P07 -> 128 colors
    .P08 -> 256 colors

   If alerts are enabled in the Help menu and the selected index is not 0,
   then you can choose the load or save from start index (color 0) or 
   the selected index.
   If help alerts are disabled, then load or save are done from the
   selected index.
 
   Palette files are completed with white color for padding if the number to
   save is higher than the present colors (from start or selected index).

   You can copy and paste one color to the clipboard (file SCRAP.P00 is used),
   with ^C and ^V, when the palette window is ontop.   

 - The Update button is for True colors environment. Realtime color change can 
   be time consuming. For large or complex image, it may be better to have it
   manual for color change seen in the raster workshop window.
   This button can be enabled in the preferences, palette tab.
   
 - Gradient can be generated between the current selected color and 
   another color from the palette choosen with right click.
   A confirm alert is displayed to eventualy cancel, if alerts are enabled in
   the Help menu.
 
 
@{0B}Sprite & mask generators@{0}:
  
   ^F5: Create sprite
   ^F6: Create mask

 - Remove mask color from sprite: usualy, sprites images set shows a flashy
   color for future transparent pixels. This function swaps this color by
   another that should be black/void.
   Use this function with the other below.
 
 - Generate image mask: select the color from the sprites images set that will
   be transparent. Other colors will be for the mask. Current palette can be
   kept, otherwise the mask image will be duochrome (one only bitplane).
 
 
@{0B}Rearrange colors order@{0}:

  Grip a color using mouse click held then drag the box at the wanted location
  in the palette.
   and  buttons cycle all colors in the palette backward/upward.
  
  Purpose is to spare the first 16 colors (index 0 to 15) for GEM objects, or
  to use colors that will not hamper windows and menu handling by the user.
  Index 0 is usualy white (or very light) and index 1 the opposite, ie black
  or very dark. 
 
  The Rollback button reset the changes, original palette order is recovered.
  
  The Commit button validates the changes. Image seems unaffected, but colors
  order in the palette is modified, so as the modified flag of the image,
  ready to be saved.
 
@endnode

@node "p2sm_images_list2" "P2SM: images list (in layer manager mode)"

 General purpose is to get sprites offsets (X, Y) from an origin point. 
  
 Child images order is important: use the up and down buttons to change it.
 On screenmodes with palette (duochrome, 16c, 256c), the main layer palette
 is the first child image one. Images of the same layer should have the same
 bitplane number between them.

 Two types of layers:
  
 ú @{0B}Assembly@{0}
    
  Child images are displayed all at once, from top-first to bottom-last image.

  Purpose is to assemble sprites for complex entities, oftenly Boss' sprites
  or entire scenes.
  First of the child images list is at the background.
  Bottom of the child images list is at the foreground.
  
 ú @{0B}Animation@{0}

  Child images are displayed one by one following the order list. 
  Control backward and forward, and delay, are set in the raster workshop.
 
  Purpose is for animation for one entity, oftenly moves.
  
  Animation can be saved if GIFenc.ldg is installed, and the second and next
  images fit in the first image.
  - Number of loops is set in the Layer details window.
  - Disposal method and delay value can be modified for each image/frame.
  - Transparency is set with the Block Nul color and Nul button in the source
    image.
 
@endnode

@node "p2sm_raster_workshop2" "P2SM: raster workshop (in layer manager mode)"

 Display is centered on the first child image, if present.
 
 To use less RAM and speed up display, it's advised to resize the raster
 workshop window to minimum visible.
 
 In the toolbar:

- @{0U}Direction keys@{0}
  
  You can use Arrows keys or buttons to move 1 pixel at a time. 
  Or 10 pixels at a time with Shift key hold.
  
  If parent layer is selected, then the origin is moved.

  If child image is selected, then its offset from origin is changed.
 
- @{0U}Coordinates@{0} (for child images)

  X and Y are offsets from origin. 
  W and H are constants from image size.
  
  For new layers, origin starts always at top-left corner of the child images.

- @{0U}Sprites controls@{0} (for child images)

  Transparency flag and color can be changed here.
  
  For correct display of transparency, the color index 0 of the image palette
  must be full white.
  
  The image can be masked if necessary.

- @{0U}Animation controls@{0} (if layer is animation type)

  Sequential display is set up here, with delay in milliseconds between images
  and bouncing flag.
  Backward is << button or Control+Left Arrow keys.
  Forward is >> button or Control+Right Arrow keys.
  Selected image in the images list changes accordingly to the animation.

   if you prefer to start with block functions and avoid drawing pixels
   at first time.
     
 ú Use cache to redraw rasters (available if enough TT-RAM).
   Big rasters may take time to be offscreen built in the raster workshop.
   If enabled, built rasters are stored in TT-RAM to speed up display
   when you select the same image afterward.

 ú When a (X)IMG file format image is saved, you may want the palette be
   ordered in XBIOS/Shifter (VDIX) order instead of the VDI one (VDI).

 ú Under True colors screenmodes, color modification can be time consuming
   because the raster has to be partialy redrawn (with the changed color).
   To be quicker and for work fluidity, you may want to see raster change
   at will and not realtime, so deselect this option. 
   Though change is automaticaly updated if you select another color in
   the palette manipulator. 

 ú When loading, you can force color remap on the new images. 
   Palette of the first listed image is used as palette for next loaded images.
   This function calls the PARX.TRM module.

@node "p2sm_preferences_layer" "P2SM: preferences: layer"

 ú Display origin with vertical and horizontal lines, with choosen color.

 ú Default delay for animation type (when this type of layer is created).

 ú Enable transparency and its color index for new child image addition in
   layer.
     
   The color index can be taken from the Nul color of the Block functions,
   or a fixed one from GEM colors (0 to 15 values).

   Transparency will be correctly displayed in the raster workshop
   if the color VDI index 0 of the image palette is full white. If not
   the image will be added with transparency flag off.
     
 ú Set masked flag on when adding image(s) to the layer. 
   If so, don't forget to unmask manually first image of the layer.

  The background color index will be considered as Gum color.
  If present, the transparent color index will be the Block Nul color with
  Nul button selected. Disposal and delays are stored silently and can be
  copied when an animation type layer is created with these images.
  
 ú Discard disposal and transparency = raw mode
   -> images will appear as the computer see it. Information is not lost.
  
 ú Transparency uses background color = color merge
   -> images may appear correct for a human, but transparency information
      is lost.
       
 ú Use disposal and transparency = human display
   -> for animated GIF, each image will be built accordingly to the datas,
      but most information is changed.
  
 @{0U}Saving@{0} (if GIFenc.ldg installed)
    
 ú Use draw Gum color as background: if not then it's the most used color,
        computed silently for offscreen build, that will be saved instead.
        This setting applies also for GIF87a format.
                                      
 ú Use Block Nul color as transparent: to enable transparency, don't forget
                 to select the Nul button besides the color index selector.
  
 When saving an animation type layer, choice is given to store:
 ú Global Color Table (of the first frame/image) = size reduce
 ú Local Color Tables (for each frame/image) = bigger file size
