                      Booz 1.02 -- Barebones Ooz

Booz 1.02 is a small, memory-efficient Zoo archive extractor/lister. 
It is not fancy.  It does not recognize the advanced features
available in current versions of Zoo, such as long filenames,
directory names, comments, and multiple file generations.  Extraction
always uses a short MS-DOS format filename and all extracted files go
into the current directory.

But Booz 1.02 is simple and portable and can be implemented in about
fifteen minutes on any system with a reasonably good C compiler that
provides **IX-compatible read(), write(), and lseek() functions.
And Booz 1.02 can extract and list all archives created by all
currently-existing versions of Zoo.

Booz makes no assumptions about the filename syntax of the host
machine, except that Small and Big Booz assume that dot "." is used to
separate the extension "zoo" from the rest of the name of the
archive.  They will append ".zoo" to the archive name if it contains
no dot;  this fails if an archive name of the type "../junk" is
specified.  

				 NOTE

This program does not attempt to be case-insensitive.  Therefore you
will need to type names of files to be extracted in the correct
case.  Note, however, that some operating systems (possibly CP/M) may
fold command line arguments to uppercase.  If this happens, your
best bet is to extract all files from an archive instead of
specifying specific names.

Version 1.00
     Corresponded to just the Tiny booz 1.02

     Included TINY, SMALL, BIG compilation options.  Had a bug in
     function needed() that sometimes cause file extraction to fail.

Version 1.02
     Fixed bug in function needed().  Added support for Turbo C 1.0.
     Revised this documentation and some comments in the source code.
