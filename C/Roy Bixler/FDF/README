This is release 1.01 of 'fdf - find duplicate files' and 'sfdf -
sorted find duplicate files'.  These were originally, in version 1.00,
released by Monk Software as 'mfd' and 'sfd'.  The names have been
changed to reflect that Monk Software no longer supports these
programs.  They were freeware (under the GNU copyleft) as of August,
1991, so this renaming is merely for clarification.

Otherwise, I have merely fixed a couple of bugs here.  Both of these
bugs were related to setting the duplicated criteria so that the file
contents have to match.  The file comparator would crash the program
if there happened to be a couple of files of length 1 under
consideration.  The version 1.0 method of printing out the duplicates
was broken in a few cases, so I re-thought this and it should now
produce more reasonable output in all cases.

I hope these programs are useful.  If you have any questions,
suggestions or bug fixes, please let me (Roy Bixler) know.  I can be
