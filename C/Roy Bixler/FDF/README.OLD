"mfd" and "sfd", which were originally released as shareware, are now
being re-released as freeware under the GNU copyleft.  So, of course,
source is included.  The binary was compiled using GNU C 1.40 and
version 10 of the MiNT library.  I'd like to hear about changes or
even just ideas for changes.  Thanks - enjoy!
