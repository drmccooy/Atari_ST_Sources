sfdf - sorted find duplicate files
Version 1.01, Copyright (c) 1992 Roy Bixler.

General Idea:

    This program finds duplicate files on your disk(s).  It is
    possible to specify multiple disks and see duplicate files across
    disks.  You have control over criteria for finding duplicate files
    and the order in which the duplicates are presented.  For the
    really business-like, there is an interactive delete mode that
    presents you with menus asking which of the duplicate files to
    delete.  As an option, a statistical summary of the duplicate
    files is printed out at the end.

Usage:

    sfdf [-ma] [-m[cdns]] [-oa|d] [-sd|n|s] [-ilv?] path [...]
        where 'path' is the starting directory for finding duplicate
        files.

Matching criteria:

    Tells program what information to consider in determining whether
    a pair of files are duplicates or not.  The default is to consider
    files as duplicates if their names, modification date/times and
    sizes match (i.e. -mdns).

        -ma - All.
            Consider name, size, date/time and contents.

        -m[cdns] - Set the matching criteria.
            c - Contents.
                File contents must match, implies 's' (sizes must
                match).

            d - Dates.
                Date/time of files must match.

            n - Names.
                Names must match.

            s - Sizes.
                Size of files must match.

Sorting criteria:

    Tells program in what order to present the duplicate files.  The
    default is to sort by names and paths only.  If any options are
    specified below, the primary sort key is changed accordingly and
    the names and paths become the secondary sort key.  The
    performance will suffer noticeably if the primary sort key is not
    one of the match criteria.  Defaults are to sort by name in
    ascending order (i.e. -oa -sn).

        -oa|d - Ordering.
            Sort in ascending/descending order.

        -sd|n|s - set the sorting criteria.
            d - Dates.
                Sort output by date/time.

            n - Names.
                Sort output by name.

            s - Sizes.
                Sort output by size.

Options:

        -i - Interactive delete mode.
            Duplicate files are listed in menus.  Type in the numbers
            of the files you wish to delete or just hit <Return> to
            leave the files alone.  The numbers can be separated by
            commas or spaces.  Ranges of numbers can be specified by
            separating the lower and upper limits with a dash.

        -l - Long listing of duplicate files.
            Gives date/time and size information on each duplicated
            file.

        -v - Verbose, print statistics.
            Give information on number of files, number of duplicated
            files, number of duplicate names, total number of bytes
            and averages of each at the end.  When in 'interactive
            delete mode', also print out how many bytes in files you
            deleted.

        -vv - Very verbose, also print activity report.
            In addition to printing statistics above, print out the
            directories searched for duplicate files.

        -?
            Print full documentation and exit.  You are here!

Differences with 'fdf':

    This program sorts the duplicate files list, which 'fdf' does not.
    It is also slower than 'fdf', but uses less memory.
