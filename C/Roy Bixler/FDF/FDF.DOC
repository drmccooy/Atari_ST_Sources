fdf - find duplicate files
Version 1.01, Copyright (c) 1992 Roy Bixler.

General Idea:

    This program finds duplicate files on your disk(s).  It is
    possible to specify multiple disks and see duplicate files across
    disks.  You have control over criteria for finding duplicate
    files.  For the really business-like, there is an interactive
    delete mode that presents you with menus asking which of the
    duplicate files to delete.  As an option, a statistical summary of
    the duplicate files is printed out at the end.

Usage:

    fdf [-ma] [-m[cdns]] [-ilv?] path [...]
        where 'path' is the starting directory for finding duplicate
        files.

Matching criteria:

    Tells program what information to consider in determining whether
    a pair of files are duplicates or not.  The default is to consider
    files as duplicates if their names, modification date/times and
    sizes match (i.e. -mdns).

        -ma - All.
            Consider name, size, date/time and contents.

        -m[cdns] - Set the matching criteria.
            c - Contents.
                File contents must match, implies 's' (sizes must
                match).

            d - Dates.
                Date/time of files must match.

            n - Names.
                Names must match.

            s - Sizes.
                Size of files must match.

Options:

        -i - Interactive delete mode.
            Duplicate files are listed in menus.  Type in the numbers
            of the files you wish to delete or just hit <Return> to
            leave the files alone.  The numbers can be separated by
            commas or spaces.  Ranges of numbers can be specified by
            separating the lower and upper limits with a dash.

        -l - Long listing of duplicate files.
            Gives date/time and size information on each duplicated
            file.

        -v - Verbose, print statistics.
            Give information on number of files, number of duplicated
            files, number of duplicate names, total number of bytes
            and averages of each at the end.  When in 'interactive
            delete mode', also print out how many bytes in files you
            deleted.

        -vv - Very verbose, also print activity report.
            In addition to printing statistics above, print out the
            directories searched for duplicate files.

        -?
            Print full documentation and exit.  You are here!

Differences with 'sfdf':

    'fdf' is faster than 'sfdf', but it does not sort the output.
    'fdf' also uses somewhat more memory.
