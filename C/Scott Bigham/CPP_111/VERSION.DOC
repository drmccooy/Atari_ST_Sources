Version notes for CPP (these are more notes to myself than anything that
should be taken as gospel, btw  -sb):

5/31/93	    Version 1.0.0 released.

6/2/93	    First bug (sigh...):  wasn't recognizing '?' as a valid token.

6/3/93	    Version 1.0.1 released.

6/13/93	    Small bug in handling of -W and -f options (strange, I know
	    they were working before...)

6/14/93	    Version 1.0.2 released.

9/7/93    - do_undef() was incorrectly calling token() rather than
	    _one_token(), and thus chewing into the next line of input.
	    Thanks to Thorsten Roskowetz for pointing this out.
	  - added some basic copyright information -- basically, you can
	    do anything you want with this program except sell it or
	    claim it as your own work, and if it blows up your house and
	    eats your dog, it's not my fault. ;)

9/8/93	    Version 1.0.3 released.

9/14/93   - [c/o Andreas Schwab] In include.c:  if find_include_file()
	    couldn't find the include file, it incorrectly returned the
	    path of the last place it checked instead of NULL.
	  - [c/o Andreas Schwab] In token.c:  when xlate_token() read
	    either of the tokens '!=' or '==', it left the last '=' in
	    the input to be re-read.
	  - [c/o Thorsten Roskowetz] In if_expr.c:  the handling of
	    '\xhh' sequences in char_const() was wildly wrong.  Not only
	    were the hex digits A-F being returned as values 0-5, but
	    the next character after the sequence (which might have been
	    the closing '!) was being skipped.
	  - [c/o Andreas Schwab]  Fixed up several function calls that
	    were passing the wrong number of parameters (if only HSC
	    did prototypes!), and deleted a few functions that were no
	    longer being used.
	  - Fixed a few comments that were out of sync with the code they
	    were commenting.

9/15/93     Version 1.0.4 released.

11/27/93  - In macro.c:  Fixed the expansion of built-in macros like
	    __DATE__ and __TIME__; they were expanding to "__DATE__"
	    and "__TIME__".
	  - In define.c:  Finally finished the macro_eq() function for
	    testing equality of macro bodies.  For the moment, it is
	    only experimental.
	  [many speedup suggestions due to Thorsten Roskowetz:]
	  - In hash.c, token.c:  Forgo explicitly free()'ing memory during
	    at-exit cleanup of the macro table; we trust the operating
	    system to do the right thing.
	  - In hash.c:  In hash_id(), pull the modulus operation out of
	    the loop.
	  - In pound.c:  Identify preprocessor directives by their hash
	    values, rather than by string comparison.
	  - In *.c:  Liberal application of the "register" keyword;
	    apparently I was putting too much faith in the optimizer to
	    do this for me.

12/17/93  - Version 1.0.5 released.

1/4/94	  Another year, another pack of bugs... :-(
	  - [c/o Thorsten Roskowetz]  In macro.c:  expand() would
	    sometimes push the token it was passed directly back onto the
	    token stream; the caller then free_token()'ed that token,
	    causing havoc.  This happened primarily when expanding macro
	    arguments.  Now we push a copy of the token when necessary.
	  - In token.c:  After calling expand(), exp_token() should
	    free_token() the token it just expanded.
	  - [c/o Andreas Schwab]  In define.c:  I knew I couldn't get
	    macro_eq() right the first time. :-/  Do string comparison
	    on the |txt| member, not the |type| member.
	  - [c/o Thorsten Roskowetz]  In *.c, global.h:  Assorted micro-
	    optimizations and manual coalescing of string constants.
	  - In macro.c:  Sigh.  The leading whitespace that expand() adds
	    to its resulting token list was being aliased directly out of
	    the token being expanded, which was later destroyed.  Now we
	    copy the whitespace properly.

1/5/94	  - In define.c:  get_parms() was losing all but the first and last
	    macro parameters.
	  - Version 1.0.6 released.

1/6/94	  - In macro.c:  Corner-case bug:  given:
	    #define a(m) m(5)
	    #define b(x) #x
	    a(b) should expand to "5"; but expand_tlist() was painting the
	    'b' blue prematurely.  Now, if a token representing a macro that
	    takes arguments is followed immediately by a STOP token, we mark
	    it to be unpainted upon return to expand_tlist().

2/19/94   - In main.c,process.c:  Added support for a config file to set
	    preprocessor constants.
	  - In pound.c:  Added pragmas CPP_cmdline_arg and CPP_delayed,
	    active only while processing config file.

2/27/94	  - Version 1.1.0 released.

3/16/94   - In define.c:  The token immediately after a ## operator
	    wasn't being checked to see if it was a macro arg.
	  - In macro.c:  The leading whitespace on a macro arg was being
	    lost when it was expanded, so that, for instance, given:
	    #define X(x) run x
	    X(on) was expanding to `runon' instead of `run on'.

4/11/94   Bugs reported by Thorsten Roskowetz:
	  - In pound.c:  The filename in a #line directive wasn't being
	    copied properly.
	  - In main.c:  In do_config_file(), incorrect handling of
	    multiple filenames specified in $LIB.

5/4/94	  - Version 1.1.1 released.
