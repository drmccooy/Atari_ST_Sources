   documentation about what all these values were supposed to be.
   I think it doesn't make any difference whether I've got them right,
   as, according to the doc I saw, the only thing that has a use for them
   is a debugger that doesn't run on the ST anyhow.  Just as well; the code
   compiles with this file, but I have no confidence that it agrees with
   anybody else's definitions
