Output of Assembler Code
========================

`ASM_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the assembler. 
     See the file `tm-sun3.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`LINK_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options you
     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`ASM_FILE_START (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.

     Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing `#NO_APP',
     which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers but tells the
     GNU assembler that it can save time by not checking for certain
     assembler constructs.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain commands;
     see `tm-attasm.h'.

`ASM_APP_ON'
     A C string constant for text to be output before each `asm' statement
     or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is `"#APP"', which is a
     comment that has no effect on most assemblers but tells the GNU
     assembler that it must check the lines that follow for all valid
     assembler constructs.

`ASM_APP_OFF'
     A C string constant for text to be output after each `asm' statement
     or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is `"#NO_APP"', which
     tells the GNU assembler to resume making the time-saving assumptions
     that are valid for ordinary compiler output.

`TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C string constant for the assembler operation that should precede
     instructions and read-only data.  Normally `".text"' is right.

`DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C string constant for the assembler operation to identify the
     following data as writable initialized data.  Normally `".data"' is
     right.

`REGISTER_NAMES'
     A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
     registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what translates
     register numbers in the compiler into assembler language.

`DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (REGNO)'
     A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the compiler
     register number REGNO.  In simple cases, the value of this expression
     may be REGNO itself.  But sometimes there are some registers that the
     compiler knows about and DBX does not, or vice versa.  In such cases,
     some register may need to have one number in the compiler and another
     for DBX.

`DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce debugging output for DBX in
     response to the `-g' option.

`SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should produce debugging output for SDB in
     response to the `-g' option.

`DBX_NO_XREFS'
     Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the construct
     `xsTAGNAME'.  On some systems, this construct is used to describe a
     forward reference to a structure named TAGNAME.  On other systems,
     this construct is not supported at all.

`DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH'
     A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
     continued (split into two separate `.stabs' directives) when it
     exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
     operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others, splitting
     must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining this macro
     with the value zero.  You can override the default splitting-length by
     defining this macro as an expression for the length you desire.

`DBX_CONTIN_CHAR'
     Normally continuation is indicated by adding a `\' character to the
     end of a `.stabs' string when a continuation follows.  To use a
     different character instead, define this macro as a character constant
     for the character you want to use.  Do not define this macro if
     backslash is correct for your system.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the expression
     `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and
     after that, output the additional assembler syntax for defining the
     name, and a newline.

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for declaring the name of a function which is being
     defined.  This macro is responsible for outputting the label
     definition (perhaps using `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in the
     usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     some commands that will make the label NAME global; that is, available
     for reference from other files.  Use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for making that name global,
     and a newline.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     any text necessary for declaring the name of an external symbol which
     is referenced in this compilation but not defined.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output anything.
      The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a reference in
     assembler syntax to a label named NAME.  The character `_' should be
     added to the front of the name, if that is customary on your operating
     system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.  This macro is used in
     `assemble_name'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.  These labels are
     used for internal purposes, and there is no reason for them to appear
     in the symbol table of the object file.  On many systems, the letter
     `L' at the beginning of a label has this effect.  The usual definition
     of this macro is as follows:

          fprintf (STREAM, "L%s%d:\n", PREFIX, NUM)

`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM, TABLE)'
     Define this if the label before a jump-table needs to be output
     specially.  The first three arguments are the same as for
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'; the fourth argument is the jump-table
     which follows (a `jump_insn' containing an `addr_vec' or
     `addr_diff_vec').

     This feature is used on system V to output a `swbeg' statement for the
     table.

     If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (STREAM, NUM, TABLE)'
     Define this if something special must be output at the end of a
     jump-table.  The definition should be a C statement to be executed
     after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
     the appropriate code to stdio stream STREAM.  The argument TABLE is
     the jump-table insn, and NUM is the label-number of the preceding label.

     If this macro is not defined, nothing special is output at the end of
     the jump-table.

`ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)'
     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type `char
     *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and the number
     NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use `alloca' to get
     space for the string.

     This string will be used as the argument to `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose name
     is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in valid
     assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time this macro
     is executed; it prevents conflicts between similarly-named internal
     static variables in different scopes.

     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent any
     conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow periods
     or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least one of these
     between the name and the number will suffice.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_DIFF_ELT (STREAM, VALUE, REL)'
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a difference
     between two labels.  VALUE and REL are the numbers of two internal
     labels.  The definitions of these labels are output using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL', and they must be printed in the same way
     here.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
                   VALUE, REL)

`ASM_OUTPUT_ADDR_VEC_ELT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses in a
     dispatch table are absolute.

     The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a reference to a
     label.  VALUE is the number of an internal label whose definition is
     output using `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL'.  For example,

          fprintf (STREAM, "\t.word L%d\n", VALUE)

`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a `double' constant whose value is VALUE. 
     VALUE will be a C expression of type `double'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a `float' constant whose value is VALUE. 
     VALUE will be a C expression of type `float'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (STREAM, EXP)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a `int', `short' or `char' constant whose
     value is VALUE.  The argument EXP will be an RTL expression which
     represents a constant value.  Use `output_addr_const (EXP)' to output
     this value as an assembler expression.

`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number VALUE.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes at
     PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type `char *' and LEN a C
     expression of type `int'.

     If the assembler has a `.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
     Unix assembler, do not define the macro `ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SKIP (STREAM, NBYTES)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to advance the location counter by NBYTES bytes.  NBYTES
     will be a C expression of type `int'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGN (STREAM, POWER)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to advance the location counter to a multiple of 2 to the
     POWER bytes.  POWER will be a C expression of type `int'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose size is
     SIZE bytes.  Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to
     output the name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     global variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream STREAM
     the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME whose size
     is SIZE bytes.  Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to
     output the name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     static variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE)'
     A C statment to output DBX or SDB debugging information before code
     for line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio stream
     STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
     information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

`TARGET_BELL'
     A C constant expression for the integer value for escape sequence `\a'.

`TARGET_BS'
`TARGET_TAB'
`TARGET_NEWLINE'
     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
     `\b', `\t' and `\n'.

`TARGET_VT'
`TARGET_FF'
`TARGET_CR'
     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
     `\v', `\f' and `\r'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (STREAM, PTR)'
     Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that requires
     different names for the machine instructions.

     The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
     assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream STREAM.  The
     macro-operand PTR is a variable of type `char *' which points to the
     opcode name in its ``internal'' form---the form that is written in the
     machine description.  The definition should output the opcode name to
     STREAM, performing any translation you desire, and increment the
     variable PTR to point at the end of the opcode so that it will not be
     output twice.

     In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire opcode
     name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to process text
     that includes `%'-sequences to substitute operands, you must take care
     of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to increment PTR over
     whatever text should not be output normally.

     If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output in the
     usual way.

`FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (INSN, OPVEC, NOPERANDS)'
     If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output of
     assembler code for INSN, to modify the extracted operands so they will
     be output differently.

     Here the argument OPVEC is the vector containing the operands
     extracted from INSN, and NOPERANDS is the number of elements of the
     vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.  The contents of
     this vector are what will be used to convert the insn template into
     assembler code, so you can change the assembler output by changing the
     contents of the vector.

     This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
     file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently, you
     can cause a large class of instructions to be output differently (such
     as with rearranged operands).  Naturally, variations in assembler
     syntax affecting individual insn patterns ought to be handled by
     writing conditional output routines in those patterns.

     If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

`PRINT_OPERAND (STREAM, X, CODE)'
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the assembler
     syntax for an instruction operand X.  X is an RTL expression.

     CODE is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways of
     printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
     printed differently depending on the context.  CODE comes from the `%'
     specification that was used to request printing of the operand.  If
     the specification was just `%DIGIT' then CODE is 0; if the
     specification was `%LTR DIGIT' then CODE is the ASCII code for LTR.

     If X is a register, this macro should print the register's name.  The
     names can be found in an array `reg_names' whose type is `char *[]'. 
     `reg_names' is initialized from `REGISTER_NAMES'.

     When the machine description has a specification `%PUNCT' (a `%'
     followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called with a null
     pointer for X and the punctuation character for CODE.

`PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (STREAM, X)'
     A C compound statement to output to stdio stream STREAM the assembler
     syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory reference whose
     address is X.  X is an RTL expression.

`ASM_OPEN_PAREN'
`ASM_CLOSE_PAREN'
     These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the syntax
     in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The following
     definitions are correct for most assemblers:

          #define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
          #define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"

The Configuration File
**********************

The configuration file `config-MACHINE.h' contains macro definitions that
describe the machine and system on which the compiler is running.  Most of
the values in it are actually the same on all machines that GNU CC runs on,
so most all configuration files are identical.  But there are some macros
that vary:

`FAILURE_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits after serious errors.

`SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits without serious errors.
