 
This file describes JRD's port of GCC, the Gnu C compiler, and related
tools, to the Atari ST.
 
A few words about GNU software:  GNU (Gnu is Not Unix) software is
published by the Free Software Foundation.  It is, as the name
suggests, free, in that they don't charge money for it.  It is *NOT*
public-domain.  The detailed description of what conditions apply to
copying and using it is given in a file called COPYING, in various
directories.  (that file is included in this distribution)  My
paraphrase of the notable difference between the FSF conditions and
public-domain status is as follows:  You are allowed to copy, enhance,
and redistribute the software; you are not allowed to charge money for
it; you are not allowed to change these conditions if you give it to
someone else.  In other words, the software is to remain free, in the
sense of not having encumberances attached to it.  In any case, read
the COPYING file.
 
What this distribution contains:
 
o  There's the compiler proper, consisting of GCC (the compiler
driver), CCCP (the preprocessor), and CC1, (the main compiler body).
The compiler is portable, and is able to generate code for a variety
of machines; the copy I distribute is, of course, configured to
generate 68000 code.  Furthermore, for the 68000 variant, you can tell
it to generate 68K code in MIT syntax or Motorola syntax.  This one is
set up for MIT syntax, but if you've got a favorite assembler, you
could use it to rebuild a version of itself to act as a front end for
your assembler.  More about that later.
 
o  The GNU Assembler, GAS.  This beast is set up to eat MIT syntax
m68K code (as produced by gcc) and generate object files in a form
suitable to be eaten by...
 
o  LD, the GNU linker.  This does the obvious thing; links together
object files to form executables.  It groks object libraries, too.
 
GCC understands how to run all the above pieces, with the result that
you can just say "cc foo.c -o foo.ttp" and the right thing will happen.
 
Other stuff:
 
o  AR, the GNU object library maintainer.  This thing takes object
files produced by GAS and crams them together into .OLB files.  It
also maintains a symbol table for the .OLB, to speed linking.
 
o  MAKE, the GNU version of the popular utility.
 
o  BISON.  This is the GNU parser generator.  You don't really need
this unless you want to rebuild the compiler completely from scratch.
 
o  A runtime library.  With a few exceptions, this is not GNU code, but
was put together by JRD.
 
 
All the above pieces are supplied in source form, as well as
executables (or OLBs or whatever).
 
All the executables, object modules etc in this distribution were
compiled with this version of GCC, 1.23.
 
 
Porting GNU:
 
Most of the changes I made to GNU things to make them run on the ST are
pretty minor.  Many of the decisions about how to do things are
somewhat arbitrary.  For instance some pathnames had to be changed;
some because the names were too long, and some because the names were
not of the form NAME.TYPE.  Examples are "a.out.h" -> "gnu-out.h" and
"parse.tab.c" -> "parsetab.c".
 
Some of the definitions needed (like in H files etc) were made up as I
went along, and thus will probably not be the same as on 'real'
Eunuchs systems.  As far as I can tell, that's restricted to things
like the debugger symbol table defs (stab.h), the object format defs
(gnu-out.h), and the defs for the format of an object library (ar.h).
I suspect it's highly unlikely that anybody will ever have a
legitimate reason for transporting those things around and hacking
them with other systems' tools, so it probably doesn't matter.
Besides, all the sources are available, so if anyone feels
sufficiently strongly that they change the format of something, they
can.
 
Since these programs started with a heavy dose of Eunuchs mentality,
anything that hacks pathnames had to be changed to look for backslash
as a directory component delimiter, rather than slash.  That turns out
to be quite a few places, but it should be completely obvious what's
going on in all of them.
 
There are also a number of places where the code assumes it knows the
format of text files (ie lines delimited by exactly one newline) which
lose with ST text files (CRLF).  Some of them are hacked by hand, and
some use special filtering read functions.  Some are left untouched;
for instance the code that reads machine-description files for cc1
will lose if you edit the MD file and save it back.  I doubt anyone
will want to hack that, but if you do, you'll have to fix the code
that reads those things.
 
There are a handful of places where I introduced environment vars to
tell various programs where to find things, as there's no canned place
to find stuff on the ST.  They are documented individually in the
places that use them.
 
There are lots of fairly random things strewn around in various
places, but I can't think of anything else worth noting here.
 
All changes to the sources are conditionalized with #ifdef atarist,
with the old code left in for commentary (or humor) value.  Since the
modified CCCP has 'atarist' as a predefined symbol, it will 'just
work' to compile the modified compiler with itself.  If, for some
reason, you want to compile this compiler (or any of these other
things) with some other compiler (why ever would you want to :-} ),
you'll need to make sure to get that def right.
 
 
The compiler configuration (look in the compiler sources at
tm-atari.h) is roughly drawn from the SUN2 definitions, with random
things thrown in, or altered to be the way I wanted them.  Mostly,
things are left the way they default from the 'vanilla' m68k defs.  A
few noteworthy points: The integer size is set at 32 bits; longs are
32, shorts are 16.  I did it this way because I can't stand compilers
that push random-sized frobs on the stack.  (It's likely that you
could change that def and compile up a compiler that uses 16-bit ints,
but it might not be able to compile itself)
 
I use an alloca that I whacked up myself; not the supplied one.
 
The floating point support is pretty ragged.  Single-floats work
moderately well, but doubles are just singles in drag, and lose a lot
of accuracy.  The float stuff really needs to be re-written
completely; I'll get around to it if someone doesn't beat me to it.
 
 
Memory requirements: (thought I wasn't going to mention that, didn't
you)
 
The compiler and assembler both use a lot of memory.  The compiler is
probably the worse offender, but they're both bad.  You shouldn't even
consider running these things if you don't have at least 1 Meg of
memory.  2 is better.  I have 2.5, and still occasionally run into a
really enormous file that overflows my memory.  In fairness, those are
really pathological cases, like the GAS m68k module, with about 80 K
of string constants and a 20-page convoluted routine to grok them.
Still, it bears mentioning.
 
The compiler shipped with this distribution is set up with a 500K stack,
which means it probably won't run as is on a 1Meg machine.  It is,
however, patchable (as one of the early users has demonstrated); just
patch the (32-bit) word at #x5b1c4 off the base to contain the stack
size you want.  For a 1Meg machine, something in the ballpark of 128K
should work.
 
While we're on the subject, you probably can't consider running this
compiler unless you have a hard disk.  I haven't added up the sizes,
but just the compiler alone is about 350K of executable.  I suppose
there's an outside chance of building a ramdisk on a 4Meg machine,
putting the esecutables in there, and having enough memory to run
them, but I doubt it.
 
 
Distribution:
 
My distribution of all this stuff consists of 6 ARCs, as follows:
 
GCX-1-23.ARC            Executables
GCC-1-23.ARC            Compiler sources
GAS-1-20.ARC            Assembler sources
GNULIB.ARC              Sources and OLB of the runtime library
GNUUTILS.ARC            Make, LD, and random stuff
BISON.ARC               Bison
 
Manifests of all those things are at the end of this blurb, so you can
tell whether you've got the right stuff.  Each arc comes with a file
called README.ST, which you should read for more info about what's
there and how to use it.
 
If all you want to do is compile and link programs, all you should
need is the executables and library, and perhaps the utils one, for
MAKE.
 
Other random stuff:
 
I forgot to include CRT0.O (the startup routine) in the GNULIB
distribution.  Just use GAS to assemble CRT0.S.
 
My object library is called GNU.OLB, rather than
<something-incomprehensible>.a.  [editorial note: How on earth did .a
come to be the acronym for a library of object modules???  I smell
historical kludgery...] The compiler driver knows how to feed the
right stuff to LD (the filename, nothing magic) to get it to link.
Look at the source or link something with "-v" to see what really
happens.
 
The linker (LD) eats GNU format object files, and produces ST format
executables.  No, they're not the same format; I always thought that
was a stupid idea anyway, and it was much easier than trying to wedge
useful object-file functionality into the ST's executable format.
Just a word of warning, in case you were expecting to be able to link
GNU objects in with other things.  Also, the linker tries to produce
an Atari format symbol table if you tell it to, but since I can't find
anything that eats them, it's almost certainly broken.
 
There are other GNU tools that I haven't gotten around to porting just
yet; in particular there's G++, their C++ compiler, and GDB, their
source debugger.  G++ looks like it should port trivially, though I
haven't tried it yet.  GDB is sort of working, but needs a bit of work
yet; stay tuned to this channel for further developments.
 
 
I guess I can't think of anything else relevant at the moment, so I'll
stop here.  Bugs and questions to me.  Good luck.
