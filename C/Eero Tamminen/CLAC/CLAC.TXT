Adding new functions to the code of Clac is quite easy. All you have
to do is:

	A. To add a single parameter function:

		1. Add the name of the function to the string in the
		   'par' structure in the appropriate place.
		2. Add one to the value of 'par.mfunc' variable in
		   the same structure.
		3. Add one case to the end of the switch structure
		   in the 'eval_func()' function and make the desired
		   function. Function will get it's parameter from
		   the 'value' variable and returns the result in
		   the same variable.

	B. To add a multi parameter function:

		1. Add the name of the function to the end of the
		   string in the 'par' structure.
		2. Add one case to the end of the switch structure
		   in the 'eval_mfunc()' function and make the desired
		   function. Parameters for the function are in the
		   variables 'val.buf[a]' - 'val.buf[b]' and their
		   count in the 'params' variable.
		3. Result of the function should be returned in the
		   'value' variable.
