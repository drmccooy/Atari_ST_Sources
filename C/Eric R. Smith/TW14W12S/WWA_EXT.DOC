   Summary:

     1. GEM RUN         = Run 1 GEM program from within TOSWIN.
     2. X SELECT        = X Window System Xterm-style cut & paste.
     3. AUTO RAISE      = Windows are optionally TOPPED when point-to-type.
     4. INITIAL REDRAW  = Screen redraw done at start-up (not with MultiTOS).
     5. BETTER TOSRUN   = Open text windows from commandline with any
                           font, position, and size; use TOSWIN for
                           TOS and TTP programs run from the Desktop.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. GEM RUN

         The RUNTOS and TOSWIN programs are modified so that 1 GEM program
         may be invoked from within TOSWIN when running as an application.

         This is only useful to users running MiNT from the desktop with
         TOSWIN as the INIT program.

         To invoke a GEM program from within a TOSWIN window, use:

               runtos -g someprog.prg arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

         To invoke a TOS program in a window from within a TOSWIN window, use:

               runtos someprog.tos arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

         ...as before.  

         This is often useful, for example if you are developing a GEM program
         and want to run it, or if you use a GEM program for displaying or
         manipulating the TOS files you are developing (eg. DVI_WIND for
         viewing LaTeX DVI output, running a RSC editor).


   2. X SELECT

         The XTerm cut & paste technique is very quick to use:

              - Click and drag to highlight a region (as normal TOSWIN).
              - Double-click to select a whole "word" of text.
              - Triple-click to select a whole line of text.
              - Right-click to paste last selected text.


         Currently, a "word" is hard-wired to mean:

              Any sequence of alphanumeric characters or the
               characters "/", ".", "_", or "@".

           or Any sequence of whitespace.

           or Any sequence of all the same character.

         So for example, "warwick@cs.uq.oz.au" could be highlighted with
         a double-click, as could "      ", "========", "/mint/lib".

         To change the hard-wired definition of "word", edit the
         CharClass function in "util.c" of the source code.


   3. AUTO RAISE

         Windows are automatically raised to the top when the mouse
         enters them (provided Point to Type is also enabled).

         This is another feature that can often be configured on the
         X Window System.

         Personally, I find it a pain in the neck under X, however, it
         is very useful in TOSWIN because under GEM, you cannot drag
         or double-click on a window (ie. do all that cut&paste stuff)
         unless it is the TOP window.


   4. INITIAL REDRAW

         When running TOSWIN from the desktop, the MiNT copyright message
         and eXtended File System messages mess up the screen.  This
         extension merely does a screen redraw when TOSWIN initializes.


   5. BETTER TOSRUN

         In addition to the original feature of being able to open test
         windows from the command line via:

             runtos someprog.tos arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

         You can now set the initial position and size:

             runtos -w x y w h someprog.tos arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

         and/or the initial font:

             runtos -f fontname fontsize someprog.tos arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

         -w and -f can be used at same time, but no use with the -g option
         described under "GEM RUN" above.

         Finally, if RUNTOS cannot find the pipe through which it talks
         to TOSWIN, it attempts to execute TOSWIN_W.PRG or TOSWIN.PRG on
         the $PATH variable.

         To use this feature under MultiTOS, edit your GEM.CNF file so that
         the directory containing TOSWIN_W.PRG is on the PATH, and so that
         RUNTOS.PRG is used to run TOS and TTP programs, thus:

            setenv PATH=.,F:\MULTITOS,F:\MULTITOS\TOSWIN
            setenv TOSEXT=TOS,TTP
            setenv TOSRUN=F:\MULTITOS\TOSWIN\RUNTOS.PRG

  
   ALSO...

         These extensions contain a number of bug fixes from the Net and
         found during the extension implementation.
