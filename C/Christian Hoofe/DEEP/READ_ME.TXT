                       Welcome to the DEEP World.



DEEP (Difference Equation Exploration Package) is a program designed to 
calculate difference and differential equation systems with a C interpreter 
on the ATARI ST/TT. It is possible to edit equation systems in an intergrated
development enviroment, to execute the code and to display the results either 
in text form or graphical form.  The Runge-Kutta integration methods of 2nd 
and 4th order are supported.

This is a test version of DEEP. When someone out there is interested in this
product, please let me know your experiences.

DEEP is a share ware product. Version 0.91 of DEEP is free because this
version is not tested well yet and the documentation is incomplete.

The version 1.0 will cost 50 DM in Germany and 40 Dollars in other 
countries. People who can't afford it, do not have to pay.

The files DEEP_MAN.TXT and DEEP_USE.TXT contain the information you
need to run the program. They are written originally for TeX, so the
format looks sometimes a little bit strange. I hope everybody can
understand my germanenglish.
