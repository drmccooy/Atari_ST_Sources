MICRO RTX SHAREWARE

This is the SHAREWARE version of MICRO RTX.

MICRO RTX is an OS replacement which works with TOS and allows
multitasking of TOS programs.   It provides the system services
necessary for implementing multitasking in your programs.

MICRO RTX is a program that can sit in your AUTO folder.  It is
something like GDOS; it doesn't do anything until a program uses
it.

Included with this shareware distribution is the complete MICRO RTX
programming manual describing how to use MICRO RTX in your programs.

If you do not know what a system call is or how to use one, and if
you don't have any programs that use MICRO RTX, please immediately
destroy this file and all copies of MICRO RTX you have.

The shareware version of MICRO RTX includes no technical support.
The BECKEMEYER DEVELOPMENT TOOLS technical consulting rate is $80
per hour, with a minimum charge of $25.  Registered users are
eligible for free techincal support using the BDT BBS and they
also receive discounts on consulting fees.
