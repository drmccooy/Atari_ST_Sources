                        MICRO RTX:  SHAREWARE AND REGISTRATION

MICRO RTX is a copyrighted ((C) 1986 - 1990) property of BECKEMEYER
DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.  It is not in the public domain and it is not free.

There are four versions of MICRO RTX.  The "shareware" version includes the
basic multitasking kernel and soft-copy documentation.  It includes a real-time
scheduler, queue manager, time manager, memory manager, and TOS compatible
I/O sub-system.

The "registered" MICRO RTX version includes all of the above plus a official
program disk and full printed and bound manual, as well as reduced rates for
consulting services.

The "regular" MICRO RTX version includes everything above plus free access to
the RTX developers area of the BDT BBS for technical support.  Registered
owners of the "regular" MICRO RTX version are also eligible for consulting
services at less than half the usual rate.

The "advanced" MICRO RTX version is for commercial developers.  It includes all
of the features of the "regular" MICRO RTX plus telephone support and free
updates.  Most importantly, the "advanced" version include an UNLIMITED
BINARY DISTRIBUTION LICENSE, granting you the right to distribute the MICRO
RTX kernel with your programs -- NO ROYALTY FEES.

Non-registered users are granted a limited license to use the shareware version
of MICRO RTX on a trial basis to determine if it meets their needs. However, if
you use MICRO RTX, you are trusted to register your use of the program.
Registration includes a program disk and printed manual at a very modest cost.

All users (including electronic bulletin board sysops, user group librarians,
and public domain or shareware distributors) are granted permission to copy the
SHAREWARE version of MICRO RTX for the trial use of others subject to the
following conditions:

   o  MICRO RTX must be copied in unmodified form, complete with the file
      containing this registration information and documentation.

   o  Except for a small fee to cover the cost of copying and handling
      (under $10), no other cost or compensation may be associated with
      the distribution of MICRO RTX.  If a fee is charged, the distributor
      must inform the recipients that this fee does not meet their
      registration responsibilities.

   o  MICRO RTX may not be distributed in conjunction with any other product
      without the written consent of BECKEMEYER DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.

MICRO RTX has been commercially available since 1986.  MICRO RTX is the result
of several years of research and development and many man hours of hard work.
BECKEMEYER DEVELOPMENT TOOLS has released MICRO RTX as shareware for the
benefit of the Atari ST community.  Registration of your MICRO RTX helps to
ensure that BECKEMEYER DEVELOPMENT TOOLS can continue to support the Atari ST
and Atari users.

Registration is available in three convenient options.  Registration-only ($35)
acknowledges your use of MICRO RTX, provides a disk and printed manual, and
entitles you to future updates.  Other options provide technical support for
developing MICRO RTX applications, with unlimited binary distribution rights
for either the regular ($75) or advanced ($250) MICRO RTX.

Please use the attached form for your registration.
