I am sending a SHAREWARE version of the MICRO RTX multitasking
operating system for the Atari ST to comp.binaries.atari.st.

I don't know for sure if Steve accepts shareware or not, but
I guess we'll see.

This distribution includes the full 80 page programmer's manual
and RTX bindings for "C".  The basic registration fee is only
$35.

The following is a press release that I'm sending out.  Press
'n' now if you don't like this sort of thing.

     SHAREWARE MULTITASKING MICRO RTX FOR THE ATARI ST!!!


      (OAKLAND, CA) BECKEMEYER DEVELOPMENT TOOLS has released a version
      of their multitasking operating system, MICRO RTX, as shareware
      for the Atari ST line of computers.

      MICRO RTX is a fully multitasking real-time operating system
      which adds multitasking extensions to TOS, Atari's native
      operating system.  MICRO RTX can run standard TOS and GEM
      programs without modifications and offers additional operating
      system services for applications, such as interprocess
      communication, installable device drivers, file and record
      locking, device control, real-time prioritization of tasks,
      efficent memory management, event signaling, message passing,
      and much more.

      Full programming documentation is included with the shareware
      version, including source code to "C" bindings for popular
      Atari ST "C" compilers.

      End-user registration is a modest $35, which includes the program
      disk and printed manual.  Full developer status with technical
      support services is $75.  An advanced commercial version which
      includes an unlimited binary redistribution license is $250.
