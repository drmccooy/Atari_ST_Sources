
			      Sozobon C Compiler

			       Sozobon, Limited

			         Disk Release

      This disk contains an update to the Sozobon C compiler as well as two
      other libraries contributed by David Brooks and Ian Lepore. The first
      is an enhanced floating point library that includes some bug fixes to
      the original Sozobon library as well as several additional routines
      not previously available.  Ian Lepore has filled another hole in the
      original release of the compiler by providing AES and VDI bindings.
      Versions 1.2 and 1.3 of these libraries are provided here. The older
      version is complete with source code, documentation and examples.

      Also included is a debugger which is like the old UNIX 'adb'.
      The Sozobon debugger 'szadb' was written by Don Dugger and
      Johann.
