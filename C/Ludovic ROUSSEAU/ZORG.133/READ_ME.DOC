  The program and the docs are in french. I am sorry for that but it is still
easier for me to write in french. This text is, for the moment, the only text
in english (bad english in fact). When I have time I will translate de doc and
the program. Perhaps someone can do that for me ?

  Ok , let's go...


  Ze ORGanizer (ZORG) is a program which allows you to do all you always wanted
to do with your disks ou file systems.

  The main goal is to consult and/or change a file. ZORG is a program like DISK
DOCTOR or MUTIL but is really better :-). It has, for example, the capability
of editing 2 or more files at the same time in nice GEM windows.

  The second goal is to reorganise a file system. Before a reoganisation
(compression in the PC-DOS vocabulary but no data are compressed) I recommend
you to backup your disk.

  The third goal is for people for wich the architecture of a TOS file system
has no secret. They have the possibility to change a directory entry or the FAT
directly.


  The fourth goal is to test the structure of the file system. It is a kind of
'fsck' for TOS. It is very important to regularly verify the file system and
especialy after a system crash during a disk write.


============================================================
ATTENTION - WARNING - ACHTUNG - ATENTION - WARNING - ACHTUNG
============================================================
  BEFORE ANY READ OR WRITE OF A FILE AND BEFORE ANY REORGANISATION YOU MUST
TEST THE DISK STRUCTURE WITH 'Test de la Structure'. IF ZORG DETECTS A PROBLEM,
YOU HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM DEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER. REORGANISING AN
UNTESTED DISK MAY LEAD TO A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PARTITION. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED.



USABLES COMPUTERS:
==================
  ZORG should work on any Atari computer (ST/STf/Mega ST/STe/Mega
STe/TT/Falcon030 and compatibles).

  ZORG uses the system functions to access disks, it potentialy can use any
kind of disks recognised by the system.

  ZORG is also able to access drives with very low level functions. It support
ACSI, SCSI and IDE drives. For computers without the DMAread() system call
(i.e. ST/STf and STe) I have writen my own low level routines. They work great
on a MegaFile 30 but are untested on other drives.


LIMITS OF THE PROGRAM:
======================
  ZORG only recognises TOS partitions. Minix or MAC partitions are not
suppported. you can however access files on those partitions if the adequat
driver is loaded (MINIX.XFS under MiNT for Minix partitions).


NOT YET IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONS:
==============================
  Some functions are not yet implemented. They are "Ouvrir la FAT" (open the
FAT), "Rassemble les R‚pertoires" (gather directories) et "Les Trois Phases"
(the 3 phases) and the possibility to search backward.
  They will be added as soon as I have time. The file CHANGES.TXT contains a
list of planed improuvements (sorry this file is in french).


STILL TO DO:
============
  If you wish to see a new option or possibility in ZORG, if you have
discovered a bug ou if you simply want to great me for this work, you can (you
have to) send me a mail to rousseau@cnam.cnam.fr.


WARANTY:
========
  Use at your own risks and remember : MAKE BACKUPS !
