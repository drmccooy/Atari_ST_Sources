						AUTOCONF

  AUTOCONF is a utility that let you configure the file ZORG.INF in a more
pleasant way than manually :-) . It is used to get the partitioning of a Hard
Disk. The partitioning is used by ZORG only when you select "A partir de
ZORG.INF" (from ZORG.INF) in the menu "Information".

  In normal cases you don't have to use this option. But Zorg has been written
to be used in not normal cases (disk crash, system crash when writing, bug in
the driver causing problems, or any other various problem) so I found usefull
to be able to access a partition even if the driver is not loaded. With this
possibility you can use Zorg and access files in the same way as if the disk
had booted.

  Of course you have to use AUTOCONF ** BEFORE ** any problems occurs, i.e. us
it right now !

  You can verify the configuration by chosing "A partir de ZORG.INF" and
accessing the partitions. If the configuration is correct, you won't notice any
difference.


  As always, you use this program at your on risks. If any damage bla bla
bla...


  AUTOCONF recognise three types of partitions : GEM, BGM and XGM.
GEM is the normal partition (max 16 Mo)
BGM is a extended partition (max 512 Mo ??)
XGM is not a partition but a set of other partitions (GEM, BGM or XGM). XGM
partitions are used because there is only room for 4 partitions in the Hard
Disk Boot Sector. If you have 5 partitions on your hard disk, you will have 3
GEM partitions and a XGM one. The XGM contains 2 other GEM partitions. An XGM
partition points to a boot sector of the same kind that the first one.

Illustration of the previous example:

Partition nø : type
            0: GEM
            1: GEM
            2: GEM
            3: XGM -> 0: GEM
                      1: GEM
