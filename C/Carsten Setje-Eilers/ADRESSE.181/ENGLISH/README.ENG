Notes to the english ressource-file
===================================
To use the english rsc-file move it in the same directory as the app.

If you like to call the program 'address' instead of 'Adresse', you need
to have a file-monitor, because you have to patch 7 Bytes in the app.
Please read the doc 'translator' for further advice.

Thanks a lot to Peter A. West, London, who did the translation.
