# A simple shell script to invoke the Gofer interpreter and set the path
# to the prelude file.  Ultimately, you might want to copy this file into
# your own bin directory so that you can record your favourite command line
# settings or use a different prelude file ...

# first, the location of your prelude file:
GOFER=/usr/local/lib/Gofer/standard.prelude
export GOFER

# next, command line argument settings.  One example might be:
# GOFERARGS="-pGofer: -rit -s +k" but I just stick with the defaults
# here:
GOFERARGS=

# The next few lines try to guess a suitable setting for the EDITLINE
# variable.  If your favourite editor is not dealt with here, or if
# the version of sh that I'm using is incompatible with every other
# shell out there, you may need to modify (or remove) this section:
#
case `basename ${EDITOR-none}` in
    emacs | vi | elvis )  EDITLINE="$EDITOR +%d %s"; export EDITLINE ;;
    none               )  ;;
    *                  )  EDITLINE=$EDITOR; export EDITLINE ;;
esac

# Finally, start the interpreter running:
exec /usr/local/lib/Gofer/gofer $GOFERARGS $*
