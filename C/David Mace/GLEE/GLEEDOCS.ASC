	A Brief Introduction To the Graphic Library Editor (GLEE)
			     By David Mace


Creating a GLEE file

   Select 'Create GLEE file' from the menu. Select the resolution (I will 
include the TT resolutions when I get more information about the TT's screen 
layouts), then enter the width and height (in pixels) of the new file. Note: 
the width will be rounded to the nearest 16th pixel. Images from 128x128 
pixels to 65535x65535 are supported, but won't necessarily fit into RAM.
You may add an extra masking plane and select the masking button. GLEE
will do nothing extra with the memory form until you dump it. It then
ORs all of the planes together onto the last (masking) plane. In your program
all you will need to do is NAND (D'=S&!D) that plane onto all of your
destination bit planes and OR the other planes in to nicely copy over 
background data.

Load/Save GLEE file

   (Same as 'Import') Save will attempt to save the active (top) window as a 
GLEE file. This will not work on a DEGAS image.

Importing a DEGAS/NEOchrome format picture

   Select 'Import DEGAS/NEOchrome' from the menu and use the file selector box. 

Importing .DLT and .SEQ animation files

   These options allow you to create complex game animations using the Cyber 
family of animation programs. Do all animations against a blank (zero mapped) 
background. Keep your object in one location (i.e. don't move a walking 
man across the screen) and all of the offsets for the sequence will be 
calculated correctly. Both of these functions require you to create a GLEE 
file ahead of time. Look at your animation and guess about how much space it 
will take up. Create different files for your different sequences. (I.e. 
guy.seq, car.seq, squash.seq, etc.)

Dump GLEE defs

   This is the object of the whole program. Once you have defined and named all 
of your blocks, this function will allow you to produce a C file header of 
all of your work. The .GIM file is the raw memory form image. You may also dump 
the memory form containing the image of the file to be compiled directly into 
your program. Note that a 32000 byte image will equate to an over 112000 byte 
C header. Select only the offsets you are using. 
   Very large images won't fit onto a floppy in this format and may not fit 
onto your hard drive, either. (Consider also that the compiler will want to 
create temporary files with this info.) The individual block images will be 
alphabetically sorted by name and dumped as an array of struct GLEBLK. 
Characters that are illegal in a C variable name are converted to '_'.
   Dump GFA will dump definitions for the BITBLT function (2.0 & up).
BONKDEMO.BAS is a sample using GFA BASIC. Just merge the .LST file into
your program and edit it to taste. If you find you want more specific info
about the .GIM memory form, dump it as a C header and print that out.
   The header (.H), GFA (.LST) and the .GIM image are your property. GIM files
are just the raw memory form, and the header or .LST file is just a bunch of
simple definitions to use the .GIM image.
   You have the option to dump the GLEE definitions in Line-A (XYWH) or VDI
(X1Y1X2Y2) formats. The VDI format will dump the width and height as well
since they are useful for calculating the destination rectangle's X2Y2.
   As with Save, The program will attempt to dump the active window. 

Show colors

   Selecting this will cause the program to switch to the pallet of the 
currently selected window and any subsequently selected window unless you are 
in High rez.



                        The full window dialog

   Once a file is created or imported and its window is on the screen, it may 
be manipulated. Click on the full-window icon at the upper right corner of the 
window. A little cluster of icons should appear there.

CANX
   Cancel, do nothing.

(Arrows)
   Full screen this window.

DEF
SRC
   Click on this icon and this file will be the source from which definitions 
are made.

DEF
DST
   Click on this icon and this file will be the destination to which defintions 
will be made.

?
   Click on this icon to display information about a window. On a DEGAS import 
window an option to upgrade to GLEE is available. Selecting upgrade will 
bring up a search pattern dialog. 1x1 is the slowest, finest search, 3x3 is the 
quickest, coarsest search. The program will scan for significant information 
in the picture.  The definitions must be surrounded by the background color 
(color 0) with at least two pixels separating graphic objects. Any grid or 
fill pattern in the background should be removed before trying to use this 
function or it will simply define the entire image as one block. After it has 
found an object, it will outline it and pop up a dialog next to it. The arrows 
allow you to change the border around the object. Name the object something 
descriptive, like 'Spaceship'. If it is part of an animation, name it something 
like 'Spaceship a'. Be sure to name them all something different for easy 
reference later. 

(Rectangles)
   Outline defined objects in this window.

RE-
SORT
   This function will call up a dialog which gives you control over how blocks
are sorted and allocated in the window you called it up on. The allocation
controls set the way blocks are stored in the form. 'SEEDS' are the
the starting points for the two dimensional allocation. Click on the corners
to turn them off or on. FIRST FIT and BEST FIT are the two available space
allocation methods. FIRST FIT is faster, BEST FIT is more thorough. The sort
parameters control the way the block list is sorted. WIDTH tells the program
that blocks are to be sorted by width (sometimes useful in wide forms). HEIGHT
will cause blocks to be sorted by height. WIDTH+HEIGHT causes blocks to be
sorted with both width&height taken into consideration. Selecting 'Sort Blocks'
will cause the form to be resorted immediately. Selecting 'Set Allocation'
will cause the current parameters to be set for this window and will effect
copies to/from this window. Cancel will cancel all changes. Note that once
a GLEE file's seeds have been used, they will turn off. This simply speeds up
later copies/sorts.

(Trash can)
   Pressing the right mouse button will pop up an outlined crosshairs cursor. 
If you click on an object, it will be killed. The window will scroll if you 
move the pointer off of it. To cancel, click on blank space.

(Linked rectangles)
   Go to offset screen with this window's contents. Allign images to a 
parent image by clicking on the image, then the parent, then alligning 
and clicking the child over the parent. (I.e. if ship01 is the first image 
in a sequence, allign ship02, ship03, ship04, etc to it.) There are 
keyboard equivalents for the icons at the bottom og the screen; left and 
right arrows and Esc. This is also the place to go to rename objects. 
   Offset0 contains the original XY position the object occupied in the source 
form. (If a picture of Brazil came from a map of South America, the original 
position in that map is preserved.) Offset0 may be redefined if it is 
not needed.
   If you come up with a way to make this work better, I'd like to hear it. 


                                Defining blocks

   All block definitions and copies are initiated with the right mouse button. 
A source and destination window must be selected or you will get an idiot 
message.

Import image -> GLEE
   A small crosshair will appear when you press the right mouse button. 
Pressing a button will cause the program to search for the edges for you. This 
search is not as intelligent as Upgrade, but as long as objects have at least 
one pixel of separation, it works fine.
   If you hold down the Alternate key when you press the right mouse button, 
a big set of crosshairs will appear on the source form. Move the crosshairs to 
the upper left corner of the piece of the image you want to define, press and 
hold a mouse button, then drag the rectangle to its width and height. This 
function is most useful for tightly packed graphics or graphics that are not 
zero mapped.
   For all initial definitions, A dialog will pop up and allow you to 
re-adjust the definition [to its smallest size] and name it.

GLEE -> GLEE
   A small crosshair will appear on the source window. Click on a defined block 
and it will be copied to the destination.
   Holding down Alternate will pop up an alert: Copy all blocks?. Answering 
'Yes' will cause the program to attempt to copy all of the source blocks to the 
destination.

GLEE Tips

   To compress your images into a memory form of smallest possible size, create 
a smaller memory form and copy all blocks to it.


Notes:

   GLEE seems to be somewhat sensitive to some desk accessories. I have 
not been able to track down this glitch.... Symptoms of this problem 
are randomly hanging up or crashing. To be safe, run without accessories 
and, as always, save often.

Coming soon (with sufficient interest, feedback and income):

   A real instruction manual designed on a desktop publisher. With 
illustrations and everything.

   Better allignment system.
