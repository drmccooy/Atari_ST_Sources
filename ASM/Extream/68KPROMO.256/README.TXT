At the request by Britelite / Dekadence, I did a short 256b intro to promote the
combined 256b intro compo at the 68K Inside party in Aulanko, Finland
24.-26.05.2024 for the Revision 2024 party.

Some info about this intro.

It mainly uses OS stuff, so in practice it should run fine on any 16/32-bit
Atari computer, with any monitor configuration and resolution.
No sound.
