        This is the documentation for MONO_EMU.PRG v5.00

     The  mono emulator lets you use the high resolution mode  on 
the atari ST, using a normal TV or monitor - i.e., you don't have
to fork out  œ150 on an Atari SM125 High-rez mono monitor, if you 
want to run programs that normally only run in high resoution. 

     The main use of the Mono Emulator is in running the large 
number of public domain mono-only programs. But there are also some
commercial programs such as Signum and PCB Designer that also only
run in monochrome.

     This is the fifth major version of the program.  The  first 
was  printed in Popular Computing Weekley in Vol 6 Nos 43  &  44. 
This version has a number of improvements:

     o It will now run on any TOS, anywhere in the world
     o It can (must actually) be run from an AUTO folder
     o It works with SNAPSHOT.ACC and other similar programs
     o It is twice as fast as versions 1 and 2
     o It does not crash if you run it on a mono monitor
       so you can leave it in the AUTO folder

How to use it.
--------------

     Just copy it ( MONO_EMU.PRG ) into an AUTO folder. Then boot 
from  this disk.  It will load automatically and display a  short 
message.  There  will  be a prompt at the bottom  of  the  screen 
asking  you to input  a number from  10 to 80.  This controls how 
often  the  screen is updated and also, how much your program  is 
slowed down by the emulator.  An input of 10 gives a rather jerky
display, but there is no noticeable decrease in speed.  Using 80,
is very smooth  but the  ST runs at about 56% of its normal speed
If you just press " Return", you will get the default setting  of
40, the ST will run at  75% of its  normal speed and the  display
will be quite smooth enough.

     After  entering  the speed,  you should  be  returned  to  a 
monochrome desktop with a grey background and little  icons.  You 
should  now  be  able to load and  run  any  monochrome  program. 
The mono emulator uses  about 34K  of memory, so if you have only 
got 512K of RAM then you may  encounter problems with some of the 
larger  programs.   This is  more likely  if you  have some  desk 
accessories loaded.

     You should use the mono emulator from an AUTO folder.  If you
simply load the program in the normal way, you will get a squashed
half-screen  version of the desktop.  If  you  now  go up  to  the
Options menu, select "Set Preferences"  and then click  "OK",  you
will get the normal mono desktop back, but the menus and the dialog
boxes will be squashed.  Most odd!

     It does occasionally crash when trying to set up the machine
to the right resolutions, it should work the next time it is run. 
It does not do this very often.

Auto Folder Problems
--------------------

     The ST sometimes gets very confused with it's auto folder. If
you find that it crashes for no apparent reason then copy the programs
out of the auto folder, delete the folder, create it again and copy
the programs back in again, one at a time. The ST will run these 
programs in the order in which you put them in the folder, not in the
order they appear in a directory window. It is probably a good idea
to put the Mono Emulator in first, so the machine will be correctly
configured when the other AUTO programs are run.


History
-------

Version 0 - July 1987, Wanting to get a demo of PCB Designer to run
I experiment with various methods and after two days I get one to
work, thus the MONO EMULATOR is born. I am quite pleased with it and
wonder if it could possibly be of much use to anyone. I send it off
to PCW with little hope.

Version 1 - October 1987, Published in Popular Computing Weekly, uses 
hundreds of ROM calls and is rather slow. I sell about 150 copies at
four pounds each

Version 2 - June 1988, The new ROMS start to proliferate, I write 
version 2 to run on the new ROMS using one ROM call. Very few version
twos are sent out.

Version 3 - June 1988, I have a flash of insight and make it twice as 
fast. Version 3 spreads across the world. Robtek start selling a Mono
Emulator for 40 pounds, I realise I may have made a minor marketing
error. But I have never heard of anyone buying the Robtek version.

Version 4 - Sept 1988, I discover that it was defaulting to speed 10
on the new ROMs, I remove this bug and stop it slowing down during
disk accesses. Only one copy of version 4 is sent out.

Version 5 - November 1988, Having been flooded by letters along the lines 
of : "Das Monoemulator c'est nicht funkzioneert" from the continent and
the USA I sit down and work out how to make it work with any TOS. This,
I think, will be the final version. Robtek are bankrupt. Every ST owner
in britian has a copy. I have recieved two contributions for shareware
one from the USA, the other from Sweden. I sometimes wonder if making it
Public Domain was a good idea. How many copies would have sold at a tenner
a go? In the depths of depression and strickened with poverty, I am forced
to go and work for 'Binary Design'.


     If  you  want to  write to me  with  any problems, praise, 
comments, money (it is shareware you know, and it saved you 150 quid), 
or anything else then write to:

			    Version 5.10



     This version uses the Blitter to convert mono to mid-rez screen.
Speed is increased about 50% with this new feature.For example,using
40 for speed leaves about 84% of processor time left.Using 80 for speed
is very smooth and the ST run at about 68% of its normal speed !!!.
Using 100 (i.e 25Hz refresh frequency) is smoother but ST run at about
60% of its normal speed...Thanx to Mister BLITTER (say 'Yeah !').
I think 50 is the best speed (ST runs at 80% of its normal speed).
     Also,original code by Mick West.I only added blitter routs,and
some few stuff too (like XBRA for vectors).I did optimise the rest of
the code,so now it's shorter (but faster,say 'Yeah !').
