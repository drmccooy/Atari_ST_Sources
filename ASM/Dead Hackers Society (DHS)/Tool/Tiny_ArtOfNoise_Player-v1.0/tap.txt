
Tiny ArtOfNoise Player v1.0

May 31, 2000



About.

This is a simple little player for "Art Of Noise" music files
made with Amiga. It is a .ttp program which works from any
enviornment including virtual consoles in MiNT.

There already exists a GEM player for AON/Chorus songs which
Tat/Avena made. It does however not work with multitasking
systems (of several reasons) and naturally not from virtual
consoles.



Requirements.

A Falcon with 1mb should do it. Any TOS compatible OS should
work (not tested with anything but MiNT). SWE/YesCrew has
reported freezeups sometimes, which I have not been able to
reproduce myself. So be a bit careful so you don't have
important unsaved data open.



Technical.

Art Of Noise (later renamed to Chorus) is a combined synthesizer
(ala C-64 SID) and digisynth (ala protracker). It means that it
is possible to mix the synth and digital voices freely.

AON have normal Amiga 4 channel mode and an extended 8 channel
mode as well. The 8 channel mode plays alot better in this
Falcon version than the original Amiga does (thanks to DSP
voice mixing).



Useage.

You are using this program at your own risk. None of the
persons who has been involved creating this program can be 
help responsible for any damage it might do.


Source.

It's very badly documented in some parts. 
Feel free to modify as you like.
There are static buffers for the text segments, some day I'll
make dynamic memory reservation instead. It means you have
8k wasted ram even though it might not need all that.
