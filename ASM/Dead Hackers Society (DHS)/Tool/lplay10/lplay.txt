Hacking Lance Protracker player v1.0

Protracker player for STe and
Mega STe computers.

Versions for 12.5, 25 and 50 kHz
mixing.


Why?

As aid for musicians writing music
for demos or games using the 
Hacking Lance Protracker routines.

They can easily play their mod
at the desired mixing quality to
hear how it will sound in the demo
or game.

Compatibility

The replay is using the LMC1992 and
much self modifying code, so it's
probably only working with STe and
Mega STe computers.

It will load most Noise/Protracker
files and play them fine. But there
are likely some that won't work and
might even crash.  Use at own risk!

The replayer is highly optimized for
speed. If you are looking for a
Protracker player with optimal sound
quality and small memory footprint,
look elsewhere :-)
