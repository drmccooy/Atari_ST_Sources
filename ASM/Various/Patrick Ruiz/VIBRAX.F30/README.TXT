            (!) 06-03-94 Version Deus Ex Machina Software

 This program runs on the FALCON ...
 All resolutions accessory
 NVDI, BlowUP & SreenBlaster compatible.

 What does the folder VIBRAX Contains:

 VIBRAX  .ACC       the accessory itself
 README  .TXT       this text

 PROBLEMS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER:
 VibraX perturbes the keyboard reading, that generates partasites characters,
 in order to minimize them you can suppress the repetitive function of the
 keyboard and only use the mouse with the arrow keys and Alternate.
 this is a fault present in the routine from the BITMasters, but maybe i'll
 be able to fix it with the new functions on the falcon?

 Thanks to BITMaster for these wonderfull routine.
 It is for the moment the best MODs player routine ever seen on all machines.
 
 (Rectification: it needs less CPU-TIME than CPU_MOD (new and available!).
  But CPU_MOD.ACC occures no bug, is with more options and generates the best
  quality music ever heard on a machine).

 If this program enjoyed yourself don't hesitate to tell me it in a letter.
 If you find reproductive bugs, note them and send them to me in a letter.
 If you send me enough money to give you a disk and a response, you'll receive
 a corrected version of the program with other programs made by me or my
 brother ...(don't forget to give your complete address and your configuration)
 Same if you want to exchange programs (only legal programs) you can contact us
 sending a letter at the address at the end of the text (in english or french).
 Same if you have ideas of programs to give ...
