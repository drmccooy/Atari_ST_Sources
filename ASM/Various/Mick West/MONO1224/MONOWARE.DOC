                 The Mono Emulator.  By Mick West

     One  of  the few problems with the ST is  it's  inability  to 
display  all three graphics modes on a normal monitor or  TV.  The 
High  resolution  monochrome  display  usually  needs  a   special 
monitor.  Some software,  such as 'Signum' and 'PCB Designer' only 
works in monochrome mode, so if you do not a have the monitor then 
you  can  not  use the software.  This small  program  provides  a 
solution to this.  The Mono Emulator make the ST run in mono mode, 
but  provide a picture which is suitible for a normal  monitor  or 
TV. With the loss of 33K of memory and a little speed.

     To  use it assemble the program into a file called  MONO.PRG, 
then  you  just  load the program by double  clicking  it  on  the 
desktop.  You  will then be asked to enter a speed from 10 to  80. 
This is the speed at which the screen is updated. A low speed will 
give faster execution of programs,  but a slowly updated  display, 
leading  to jerky movement of the mouse cursour.  A  higher  speed 
will give a smoother display, but will slow the programs down by a 
noticable amount.  The lowest speed is 10,  this slows the ST down 
by just 10%. The highest, 80, slows it by 90% and the default, 40, 
by  35%.  The default setting is ok for most uses.  When you  have 
entered the speed the computer will reset and then will restart as 
if  it is attached to a monochrome monitor.  The desktop  will  be 
modified accordingly,  with small icons on a grey background.  You 
will  now  be able to load and run any  monochrome  only  programs 
without  any  problems.  You will probarbly get a  better  picture 
using   a   black  and  white  TV  rather  that  a   colour   one.   
     Programs that  have been tested with this are:

          Signum         (mono only)
          PCB Designer   (mono only)
          Degas Elite    (in mono mode)
          Megaroids      (in mono mode)
          The Pawn       (in mono mode)
          Shanghi        (in mono mode)

     I have not yet come across a program which works in mono mode 
that will not work with this program.

     The program was written using Hisoft's Devpak ST,  it  should 
work on any assembler. You do not need to type in the comments.
     
     You can give away copies of this program to anybody, if   you 
got  this  copy free then if you find it useful then  please  send 
some money to me as a token of your appreciation,  this will  spur 
me on to write lots more useful programs like this. Thanks a lot.
