The program called FALCVID.PRG will save the current screen
as a Falcon Video file (.FV). You can then easily set this
resolution from within your own program. The data are read
directly from the video control registers, so this should
work with most software screen expanders too. It's only the
resolution and frequency that are saved not any picture data.


		Set video program
		
The program called SETVDO.PRG will change the current video
mode if you drop a .FV file on it. Gem will not work properly
if this results in a different screen size. Do not use RGB files
if you are using a VGA monitor!!! This program may damage your
monitor, use it at your own risk.


Because of a bug I haven't found, these programs doesn't always
work properly with very high resolutions or frequencies, neither
can they detect if you are using the correct monitor. I would
appreciate I someone could help. Suggestions or questions may
be sent to Johan Karlsson (d92jk@efd.lth.se).
