\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Easy programming}

This is an assembler library for the Atari Falcon. By using this I hope
to make programming a bit faster and easier. It includes a lot of subroutines
which most assembler programmers use quite frequently as well as some
less frequently used graphic routines. I have tested all routines
and they seem to work ok, but I can't guarantee it. For everything to work
properly use Devpac 3 with ignore multiple includes active. Most things
will probably work nice with Devpac 2 too.

If you have made a routine I would appreciate if you sent it 
to me, that way I could include it in the Falcon Library for the
benefit of everyone. Please send any questions, bugreports
or contributions to me. My address is at the end of this document.

\subsection{How to use it}			
			
Following are short descriptions of all included routines. Most are
subroutines and should be called with 'bsr' or 'jsr' unless the word
macro follows the routine name in which case it is a macro. If a
routine says 'destroys a lot' then you should save all the registers
you are using except a7 which is never ruined. Some routine descriptions
even contains an example, so hopefully there will be no problems
understanding them.


\section{Routine descriptions}

	 @createwindow)

closeevent: nothing (destroys a lot)
 ex.	;create a window;\\
	move.l rsrcadr,a0\\

	cmp \#1,d0 	; was it my button?\\
 	beq mybutton	; yes!\\

\section{History}

\subsection{Version 4}

This \LaTeX\ document is now included. 
True colour fade rout optimised (about 20\% faster) and
a new two pixels at once fader that is slightly faster 
is added.
A program frame added that may be used as a start for
new programs ({\sc Frame}).
{\bf @colour} in {\sc Timer} is changed.
{\bf @print} is now available in {\sc Shrtones}.

\subsection{Version 3}
			
True colour fade routine added (found in the jagdemo).

\subsection{Version 2}
			
This one has got a file that is necessary to use {\sc Dspmod} and a file
that is necessary to use {\sc Trig} included, unfortunately I forgot
them in v1. A new function in {\sc Window}, {\bf @loadrsrc} loads a resource file
and creates a window with the loaded object in it.

\subsection{Version 1}
			
The first one. Lots of files missing.
