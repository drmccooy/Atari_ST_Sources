***************************************************************************
* IMPORTANT!!!                                                            *
*                                                                         *
* When you use this routine make sure that the module you are about       *
* to play is saved in Audio Sculpture with the PACK option set to OFF!    *
* If this is not the case this routine will CRASH!!!                      *
* The files on the AudioSculpture DataDisk are packed and should          *
* therefore be loaded into AudioSculpture and saved to another disk with  *
* pack option off!                                                        *

Oversampling is an STE feature and does not work other modes (e.g. YM-2149)

On STE oversampling means:

If you use the frequency of 25 khz with oversampling, the program will
replay at 25 KHz, but frequency generation will be at 12.5 Khz 
and the program will interpolate the values between. For this, 25Khz
with oversampling-mode takes less time than 25KHz without oversampling.

For GFA and STOS the beginning of the replay routine contains this
information which starts at load address plus 28:

.L does mean long word entry which is 4 bytes
.W means word entry which is 2 bytes
.B means byte entry and is 1 byte

x means executable
r means read
w means write

 0   x	Relocate. Execute this subroutine to relocate the routine
	  and to find out how many instruments are used.
 4   x	Install STOS - Supervisor mode execution.
 8   x	DeInstall STOS
12   x	Install GFA - User mode execution
16   x	DeInstall GFA
20.L w	Pointer to the module should be set by user.
24.L w	Pointer to the end of the module.
28.L r	Pointer to the last address used after the replay routine
	telling from which address to free memory after executing
	install.
32.L r	The number of samples found could be read here.
36.W w	Output mode:
	   0 Internal sound
	   1 ST Replay Mono
	   2 Centronics Mono
	   3 Stereo Internal/Replay
	   4 Stereo Internal/Centronics
	   5 Stereo Replay/Centronics
	   6 Replay Stereo
	   7 Replay Professional
	   8 STE with full frequency control
	   9 STE with quantized frequencies
	  10 STE extended to 16-bits
38.B w	Volume control:
	   0 Off
	   1 On
39.B w	STE replay frequency:
	   0  6259
	   1 12517
	   2 25033
	   3 50066
40.B w	Internal replay frequency:
	   Frequency=614400/This value
	   so 56 for example will be 10971 Hz
41.B w	Oversampling switch(Only available in output mode 8)
	   0 Off
	   1 On
42.L r	The last address generated in the replaybuffer.
46.L r	Pointer to the start of the replay buffer
50 to 82 r	This is a structure containing for each of the four
	channels:
	  0.w	The Current Amplitude
	  2.w	The Current Period
	  4.L	The Current Sample Pointer
82.W w	Tune... 92 Corresponds to the Amiga tuning!
84.B r	Format Error. This flag is set if the module is not
	possibly to play!
