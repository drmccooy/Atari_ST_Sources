This Folder contains the sources of my DSP-Replay routs.
There must be the following files :

	USE_IT.S			; Use Sample
	TRACKER.S			; 030 Rout
	TRACKER.ASM			; DSP-Calc Part, Source
	TRACKER.P56			; and executable
	TEMPODSP.GFA			; Generator of the
	TEMPODSP.TAB			; CIA Tempos table
	URA.MOD				; a funny Module

	LISEZMOI			; ohne
	README				; kommentar !


You can use this rout in all your codes..
The only condition is to say where the rout comes from, i.e. you must
put me in the credits.

Note that it's not my faster rout (for DSP Calcs)...
It takes here 6 instructions to mix one sample and I've already done a rout
with 3 instructions..
I spread this rout and I give you the sources because I think it can be
a base for your routs or you can progress in DSP Code by understanding
and optimizing it..

As for the 030, this rout is able to play most of .MOD modules
i.e. Amiga ProTracker/NoiseTracker, FastTracker & StarTrekker on PC
Digital Tracker on Falcon.
It plays all ProTracker standard effects but for the Funk Repeat I'm
not sure of my rout because I've no module using it.
Non-implemented effects are E8 (Panning used on PC) and Effect #8.
CIA-Tempos are only available if the rout is in Timer A installed.
Note that you can have problems with old modules...


I now working on the Replay Routs of a new Soundtracker for Falcon 030 :
the MegaTracker (coded by Axel Follet / MCS)

You will get :
	32 stereo voices with full left & right volume control for each
	Left & Right Master Volumes
	8/16 bits Mono/Stereo Samples
	6 octaves - volume from 0 to 1024 - periods 16 times more precise

	New totally crazy format :
	variable number of voices and pattern length
	data are now coded on 'tracks'
	and for each pattern you give the number of the track
	to associate to each voice (cf MTM format on PC)
	255 samples
	256 effects with parameter on 1 word (65536 values)
	independant volume command

	Import & Export of most existing formats :
	Modules .MOD, Oktalyser Amiga .OKT, .669,
	MultiTracker .MTM, Scream Tracker 3 .S3M

	Accessory Player under GEM which doesn't slow the
	system and never crash.


Don't hesitate to contact me for anything...
You can write me in French, English or German...
